# Review Policy

Review the implementation against the human owner's explicit decisions, `AGENTS.md`, the root `intent.md` and `spec.md` baseline, and the approved change packet (`changes/<id>/`) named by the pull request's `Change-ID`.

## Review passes

1. **Correctness and regressions**
   - Find logic errors, broken edge cases, unintended behavior changes, and incomplete implementation.
2. **Artifact compliance**
   - Confirm the change solves the approved intent, satisfies the approved spec, and follows the approved plan.
   - Flag any undocumented material plan deviation.
3. **Security, privacy, and safety**
   - Find exposed secrets, unsafe input handling, authorization gaps, privacy leaks, insecure defaults, and dangerous operational behavior relevant to the change.
4. **Verification quality**
   - Confirm tests and other proof actually demonstrate the required behavior, and that `repo.py verify` evidence exists for the reviewed revision.
   - Flag skipped, weakened, deleted, or misleading checks.
5. **Maintainability**
   - Report complexity, duplication, or architectural damage only when it creates a concrete future cost or defect risk.

## Finding levels

- **Important**: could break required behavior, cause a regression, violate accepted artifacts or repository policy, create a security/privacy problem, or invalidate verification.
- **Nit**: non-blocking style or local cleanup. Report at most five nits; summarize additional minor issues instead of flooding the review.

Do not spend review budget repeating formatting, lint, or other findings that deterministic repository checks already enforce unless the deterministic check itself is missing or broken.

## Evidence

For each substantive finding:

- identify the affected file or behavior;
- explain why it conflicts with the accepted artifacts or repository behavior;
- state the likely impact;
- propose the smallest reasonable correction when clear.

Do not invent findings to fill a quota. A clean review may report no substantive findings.

## Separation of duties

The agent that authored a change may self-check it, but it must not treat its own review as human approval. A digest-bound approval claim in `change.json` is `unverified` process metadata, not proof of who approved. A pull-request author cannot approve their own pull request, so an agent sharing the owner's GitHub identity cannot produce independent approval. Prefer a fresh-context review for the final independent pass when practical.
